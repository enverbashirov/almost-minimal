# Profile Image Placeholder

Add your profile picture as `profile.jpg` here (optional).

Guidelines:

1. Use a square image (e.g. 400x400 or 512x512).
2. Prefer a neutral background for consistency.
3. Compress large images to improve load performance.

You can also omit the image entirely—just remove `imageUrl` in `hugo.toml`.
